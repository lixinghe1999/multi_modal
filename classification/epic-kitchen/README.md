## Data preparation

### Visual data

This step assumes that you've downloaded the RGB and Flow frames of EPIC-KITCHENS-100/EPIC-KITCHENS-55 dataset using the script [found here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-download-scripts), where you can find instructions on how to use the script. Your copy of the dataset (either EPIC-KITCHENS-100 or EPIC-KITCHENS-55) should have the same folder structure provided in the script (which can be found [here](https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/2g1n6qdydwa9u22shpxqzp0t8m)). Also you should untar each video's frames in its corresponding folder, e.g for `P01_101.tar` you should create a folder `P01_101` and put the contents of the tar file inside. 

`dataset.py` uses a unified folder structure for all datasets, which is the same as the one used in the [TSN code](https://github.com/yjxiong/tsn-pytorch). Example of the folder structure for RGB and Flow:

```
├── dataset_root
|   ├── video1
|   |   ├── img_0000000000
|   |   ├── x_0000000000
|   |   ├── y_0000000000
|   |   ├── .
|   |   ├── .
|   |   ├── .
|   |   ├── img_0000000100
|   |   ├── x_0000000100
|   |   ├── y_0000000100
|   ├── .
|   ├── .
|   ├── .
|   ├── video10000
|   |   ├── img_0000000000
|   |   ├── x_0000000000
|   |   ├── y_0000000000
|   |   ├── .
|   |   ├── .
|   |   ├── .
|   |   ├── img_0000000250
|   |   ├── x_0000000250
|   |   ├── y_0000000250
```
        
To map the folder structure of EPIC-KITCHENS to the above folder structure I've used symlinks. Use the following script to convert
the original folder structure of EPIC-KITCHENS to the folder structure above:

```
python preprocessing_epic/symlinks.py /path/to/dataset/ /path/to/output
```

### Audio data

This step assumes that you've downloaded the videos of EPIC-KITCHENS using [this script](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-download-scripts). It is the same script as the one that you will use to download RGB/Flow frames, shown above.

To extract the audio from the videos, run:

```
python preprocessing_epic/extract_audio.py /path/to/videos /path/to/ouput
```

To load the audio in `dataset.py`, Im using a dictionary, where the keys are the video names and the values are the extracted audio from the previous step. To save the extracted audio into a dictionary, run:

```
python preprocessing_epic/wav_to_dict.py /path/to/audio /path/to/output
```

This is done because the untrimmed videos of EPIC-KITCHENS are very large, and loading the untrimmed wav files in each training iteration is very slow. For other datasets with short audio clips, if you don't want to save the audio in a dictionary, and prefer to load the wav files directly in `dataset.py`, you can set `use_audio_dict=False` in `TBNDataset` in `dataset.py`.

### Pretrained models

* **TBN-epic-kitchens-55.pth**: [Download link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3w5p5wq5uwz2nhq/TBN-epic-kitchens-55.pth?dl=0). This is the full TBN model (RGB, Flow, Audio) trained on EPIC-KITCHENS-55, which we use to report results in our paper.
* **TBN-epic-kitchens-100.pth**: [Download link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ogs0ea191bht9dr/TBN-epic-kitchens-100.pth?dl=0). This is the full TBN model (RGB, Flow, Audio) trained on EPIC-KITCHENS-100. 
* **TSN-kinetics-flow.pth**: [Download link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nd5ruq1jnufp19o/TSN-kinetics-flow.pth?dl=0). This is a TSN Flow model, trained on Kinetics, downloaded from [here](http://yjxiong.me/others/kinetics_action/). The original model was on Caffe and I converted it to a PyTorch model. This can be used for initialising the Flow stream from Kinetics when training TBN, as we observed an increase in performance in preliminary experiments in comparison to initialising Flow from ImageNet.

## Train/evaluate with other datasets

Basic steps:

1. Extract the audio in a similar way to the one that I've shown above (.wav files for the whole dataset in a single folder). Have a look at `preprocessing_epic/extract_audio.py` for help.
2. Visual data should have the same folder structure as the one that I've shown above. To do that, map your original folder structure to the one above using symlinks, similarly to `epic_preprocessing/symlinks.py`
3. In both `train.py` and `test.py`, register the number of classes of your dataset in the variable `num_class` at the top of `main()`.
1. Under `video_records/` create *your_record.py* which should inherit from `VideoRecord`. This should parse the lines of a file that contains info about your dataset (paths, labels etc). Have a look at `epickitchens100_record.py` as an example.
2. Add your dataset in `_parse_list()` in `dataset.py`, by parsing each line of `list_file` and storing it to a list, where `list_file` is the file that contain info for your dataset.


## Training on EPIC-KITCHENS-55

To train the full RGB, Flow, Audio model, run:
```
python train.py epic-kitchens-55 RGB Flow Spec --train_list train_val/EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl --val_list train_val/EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl 
--visual_path /path/to/rgb+flow --audio_path /path/to/audio --arch BNInception --num_segments 3 --dropout 0.5 --epochs 80 -b 128 --lr 0.01 --lr_steps 60 
--gd 20 --partialbn --eval-freq 1 -j 40 --pretrained_flow /path/to/pretrained/kinetics/flow/model
```

**In the paper, results are reported by training on the whole training set. The pretrained model in `pretrained/` is the result of training in the whole training set** Train/val sets where used for development and hyperparam tuning. To train on the whole dataset, concatenate `EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl` and `EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl`, found under `train_val`, in `EPIC_train+val_action_labels.pkl` and run:
```
python train.py epic-kitchens-55 RGB Flow Spec --train_list train_val/EPIC_train+val_action_labels.pkl --val_list train_val/EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl 
--visual_path /path/to/rgb+flow --audio_path /path/to/audio --arch BNInception --num_segments 3 --dropout 0.5 --epochs 80 -b 128 --lr 0.01 --lr_steps 60 
--gd 20 --partialbn --eval-freq 1 -j 40 --pretrained_flow /path/to/pretrained/kinetics/flow/model
```

Individual modalities can be trained, as well as any combination of 2 modalities. 
To train audio, run:
```
python train.py epic-kitchens-55 Spec --train_list train_val/EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl --val_list train_val/EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl 
--audio_path /path/to/audio --arch BNInception --num_segments 3 --dropout 0.5 --epochs 80 -b 128 --lr 0.001 --lr_steps 60 --gd 20 
--partialbn --eval-freq 1 -j 40 
```

To train RGB, run:
```
python train.py epic-kitchens-55 RGB  --train_list train_val/EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl --val_list train_val/EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl 
--visual_path /path/to/rgb+flow --arch BNInception --num_segments 3 --dropout 0.5 --epochs 80 -b 128 --lr 0.01 --lr_steps 60 --gd 20 
--partialbn --eval-freq 1 -j 40 
```

To train flow, run:
```
python train.py epic-kitchens-55 Flow  --train_list train_val/EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl --val_list train_val/EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl 
--visual_path /path/to/rgb+flow --arch BNInception --num_segments 3 --dropout 0.5 --epochs 80 -b 128 --lr 0.001 --lr_steps 60 --gd 20 
--partialbn --eval-freq 1 -j 40 --pretrained_flow /path/to/pretrained/kinetics/flow/model
```

Example of training RGB+Audio (any other combination can be used):
```
python train.py epic-kitchens-55 RGB Spec --train_list train_val/EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl --val_list train_val/EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl --visual_path /path/to/rgb+flow --audio_path /path/to/audio --arch BNInception --num_segments 3 --dropout 0.5 --epochs 80 -b 128 --lr 0.01 --lr_steps 60 --gd 20 
--partialbn --eval-freq 1 -j 40 
```

`EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl` and `EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl` can be found under `train_val/`. They are the result of spliting the original [EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations/blob/master/EPIC_train_action_labels.pkl) into a training and a validation set, by randomly holding out  one untrimmed video from each participant for the 14 kitchens (out of 32) with the largest number of untrimmed videos.  

## Testing on EPIC-KITCHENS-55

To compute scores, save scores and labels, and print the accuracy of the validation set using all modalities, run:

```
python test.py epic-kitchens-55 RGB Flow Spec path/to/checkpoint --test_list train_val/EPIC_val_action_labels.pkl --visual_path /path/to/rgb+flow --audio_path /path/to/audio --arch BNInception --scores_root scores/ --test_segments 25 --test_crops 1  --dropout 0.5 -j 40
```

To compute and save scores of the test sets (S1/S2) (since we do not have access to the labels), run:

```
python test.py epic-kitchens-55 RGB Flow Spec path/to/checkpoint --test_list EPIC_test_s1_timestamps.pkl --visual_path /path/to/rgb+flow --audio_path /path/to/audio --arch BNInception --scores_root scores/ --test_segments 25 --test_crops 1  --dropout 0.5 -j 40
```

For S2, replace `EPIC_test_s1_timestamps.pkl` with `EPIC_test_s2_timestamps.pkl`. These 2 files can be found in the repository of EPIC-KITCHENS-55 annotations ([link](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-annotations)).

Similarly testing can be done for any combination of modalities, or individual modalities.

Furthermore, you can use `fuse_results_epic.py` to fuse modalities' scores with late fusion, assuming that you trained individual modalities (similarly to TSN). Lastly, `submission_json.py` can be used for preparing your scores in json format to submit them in the EPIC-Kitchens Action Recognition Challenge.
